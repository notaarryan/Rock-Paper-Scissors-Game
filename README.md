<h1>Web Development 101</h1>
<h3>Project:Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
<p>This project is a part of my journey towards becomeing a full stack developer.</p>
<p>I am creating projects related to the languages i just learned to strengthen my grip on that language</p>
<p>This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game project.</p>
<p>The live version of the game is here <a></a>.</p>
<p>The responsiveness of the website is not that great because I focused more on developing my JS.</p>
